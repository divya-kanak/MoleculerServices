-   User can add product in the cart.
-   User can get his cart details

## DATABASE

-   [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/)

## Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start project at development
npm run dev

# Run seeder
GET - http://localhost:3000/api/seeder

# Start production
npm start

# Run unit tests
npm run test
```

> NOTE :

-   I haven't mocked elasticsearch and redis for unit test so, please make sure to keep docker up during unit test run.
-   Also, I have added actions like seeder to pre-load data and haven't written unit test for that so, it will affect overall coverage.

```bash
# Run ESLint
npm run lint

# Docker up
npm run dc:up

# Docker log
npm run dc:logs

# Docker down
npm run dc:down

```

## Run at Docker

```bash
### environment (production)
- `cp .env.example .env`
-  make changes into .env
-  docker-compose up --build -d
-  Open the http://docker-ip:3000 or http://localhost:3000
```

## How to scale services?

-   Using docker compose scale command to scale service (https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/scale/). for example,

```bash
1. docker-compose scale auth=2
2. docker-compose scale product=2
3. docker-compose scale cart=5
```

## How to scale cart service?

docker-compose scale cart=5

## Mention some micro-services specific pattern you used and why?

Based on micro-service architecture, Every service is the loosely coupled services that can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently. The project uses micro-service architecture the same as. Every service having own node. Make communication with each other and make a large and scalable system. By using we can scale the service independently which offers improved fault-tolerant whereby in the case of an error in one service the whole application doesnâ€™t necessarily stop functioning. When the error is fixed, it can be deployed only for the respective service instead of redeploying an entire application.
